Chapter 4 questions:

Question | Answer
--- | ---
*Can you make a temp directory?* | `mkdir tmp` this makes a directory called tmp.
*Can you make a log directory in your clas directory?* | `cd ~/w`(tab)`/d`(tab)(enter) `mkdir log` This changes to your class directory, then makes a directory called log

A question I had was what does the -p option do?
From unixhelp.ed, it says:
--parents
no error if existing, make parent directories as needed
I figured out that this means you can make multiple subdirectories in one command. if you dont include the -p, and you try, it will say 'no such file or directory'
