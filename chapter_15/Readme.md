Can you put "This class is fun" into bar.txt? | `echo 'this class is fun' > bar.txt`
Can you add the debugger gem to your gemfile? | I would do this using `echo "gem 'debugger'" >> Gemfile` Im not sure how to do it using cat unless you already had a file with the text "gem 'debugger'" in it. if you did, say debugger.txt, then you could run `cat debugger.txt >> Gemfile`
