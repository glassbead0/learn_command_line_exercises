In the chapter 9 directory, I made a directory called orange, and `touch`ed a file called `juice` 
When I when up one directory and tried `rmdir orange` it told me that orange is not empty, and would not delete it. This wanring is helpful because removing directories can be dangrous. There may be many subdirictories and files, and you dont want to accidentally delete something you want to keep.
